## Github Workflows

These github workflow files were initially automatically generated by the Azure Static Web Apps. They manage creation of 
branch-specific copies of the client and API for testing purposes during pull requests, and the CI/CD for the `master` 
and `dev` branches.

The secrets referenced in the .yml files can be configured [here](https://github.com/MechanicalPriest/Salvation/settings/secrets)
