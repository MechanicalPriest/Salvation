## UI for Mechanical Priest Toolkit

The UI project for MPT is written in ReactJS, leaning on [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) for layout and control components.

To run this:

1. Create an `.env.development.local` file and include the following in it, replacing the URL/Port with the URL/Port of your development API:

```
REACT_APP_API_ROOT=http://localhost:7071
```

2. Run `npm start`

Note: It is suggested you use the React Developer Tools browser addon to assist with debugging.
